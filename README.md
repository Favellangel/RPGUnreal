# RpgUnrealBP

Simple implementation of an RPG game. (In the source folder there is a video showing the game interface)
This project was split into 3 conditional systems and components.

1 inventory system. It includes
• inventory items;
• what the character is wearing;
• Hotkeys;
• Widgets;
Also, the system contains sub systems, such as the crafting system. Well, of course, all the specific logic. Dragging and dropping objects, putting them in the inventory, throwing them out of the inventory, etc.

2 quest system. It has a widget that displays tasks, as well as a quest log widget. It contains detailed information (completing quests, current, failed). 3 types of quests have been developed:
• kill enemies
• find an item
• talk to the NPC

3 save system. This system is responsible for saving and loading the game. Of all the data, the following are saved.
• Data related to the inventory system. (what items the character has, what the character is wearing, etc.)
• Data related to the character. (Health, accumulated experience, damage, position, etc.)
